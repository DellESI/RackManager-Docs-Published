# RackManager-Docs ---Dell Internal--- ---Not Public---

This is a Dell ESI internal repo containing documentation for the DSS9000 RackManager.

* For each development and production release of the RackManager Toolkit, we will create in this repo:
  * a branch with the release name containing the docs for that release
  * a GitHub tag for that release
  * a GitHub "release" containing a zip and tar file for that release

* For each release folder there are two main branches:
  * MAN_PAGES -- contains all of the user MAN pages
  * DEV_SPECS -- contains detailed development info
  
* RackManager_Main_MAN.md is the top-level MAN page which briefly touches on all components of the DSS9000 RackManager and RackManager Toolkit.

* All document formats are GitHub markdown following the RackManager development plan.

* Dell internal developers, integrators, testers and Dell partners may have access to this repo under a Dell NDA.
  * this is ***NOT*** a public GitHub site
  * all data is Dell Proprietary
