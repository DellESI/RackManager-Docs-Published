# RackManager-Docs ---Dell External --- ---Public---

This is a Dell ESI External Documentation repo containing documentation for the DSS9000 RackManager.

* For each development and production release of the RackManager Toolkit, we will create in this repo:
  * a branch with the release name containing the docs for that release
  * a GitHub tag for that release
  * a GitHub "release" containing a zip and tar file for that release

* For each release folder there are two main branches:
  * MAN_PAGES -- contains all of the user MAN pages
  * DEV_SPECS -- contains detailed development info
  
* RackManager_Main_MAN.md is the top-level MAN page which briefly touches on all components of the DSS9000 RackManager and RackManager Toolkit.
